I was born in 1998, in Ankara. I love music and i play guitar and baglama. I also like reading a book.
In my free times, i play computer games. 

I acknowledge that I have fully read and understood the contents of the course website; I will not share
my work (not even a part of it) on Piazza; I will be responsible for what has been discussed/asked on
Piazza; I will not expect any response for my questions that have already been asked or written in a 
language other than English. I understand that if I have any questions or concerns about the course
mechanics, it is my responsibility to discuss them with the instructors within their office hours.
